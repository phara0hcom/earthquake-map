# Front-End - Technical Task

Thanks for applying to work at Synspective. We have developed this small task for you to work on in your own time so that we can see how you approach solutions and as a discussion point going forwards.

Please implement the task with React and your choice of mapping library.

## The task

Using the Earthquake api data endpoint (it contains information about earthquake hazards), build a front end application that presents a list of Earthquake locations to the user and does the following:

- Displays a list of earthquakes with a summary (you can set a limit to the total amount shown).
- User can search earthquakes via date
- Plot the location of the Earthquake on a map

API end point: https://earthquake.usgs.gov/fdsnws/event/1/

Example request: https://earthquake.usgs.gov/fdsnws/event/1/query?format=geojson&starttime=2014-01-01&endtime=2014-01-02

Please create documentation for the steps required to run the project.

## Requirements

The task is designed for us to see certain qualities about the developer such as:

- Programming using React
- Using map libraries
- UI/UX Design capability
- Working with Api/Data

The test is open to let the developer choose and define how the tackle the project with
out us hinting too much what is needed to pass.

## Bonus

Big bonus points for developers who will
do the following on top of the base requirements:

- Add tests
- Use Styled components
- Performance/Optimization (Can they share any knowledge on what performs well or
  what they could do better in the future)
